# BootPlate
**A super fast, mobile-first, Bootstrap v4 theme framework for building awesome WordPress websites.**

## Preview and Docs
We've combined a working theme preview with a documentation site.  What you see at [bootplate.jdmdigital.co](http://bootplate.jdmdigital.co) is the "parent" theme.  It's pretty basic, and that's intentional.  It's designed to be [extened via plugins](http://bootplate.jdmdigital.co/plugins/) and [transformed using child themes](http://bootplate.jdmdigital.co/themes/)--just like [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) itself.

You'll find we've actually combined classes and grid options from production-ready Bootstrap 3.3.6 and from Bootstrap 4-alpha 2.  Sprinkle on a little performance work and some WordPress best practices, and you'll find Bootplate should be your go-to for all Bootstrap-based WordPress theme design projects.

## Vision
Building even totally custom WordPress themes contains a lot of repetition.  There are certain templates you just end up re-creating again and again.  Worse, you end up using a lot of functions that make the theme play well with WordPress, popular WordPress plugin classes, as well as different versions of Bootstrap.

Our vision for BootPlate is pretty simple.   Here goes.

* Use WordPress Themeing Best Practices
* Extend via Plugins (not theme-specific)
* Customize using Vanilla CSS (with some helpful stuff already there) 
* Build for Bootstrap v4 Aplha 2, with fallbacks and custom CSS for production-ready Bootstrap 3.3.x
* Mobile-first, Fast-loading (no bloat)
* No Branding--at least not ours
* Free and Open Source

There are several projects on GitHub now that helped inspire this project, including BREW, Bones, and 320.  But, this is really a starter theme for professional web designers and developers.  It doesn't include all the fancy theme customizations stuff.  Presumaby, you'll want to totally transform it--just like you would totally transform the Bootstrap theme and simply use it as a framework.

That's the vision (or intent, anyway).  Stay tuned.

## Support the Project
Bootplate is a free and open-source project produced (with love) by the nerds at [JDM Digital](http://jdmdigital.co).  If you’d like to help support it, we’d love to have you submit an issue or contribute to the project here, on GitHub.  You could also buy the team at JDM Digital a beer (and keep Bootplate free).  Or enable a little "Theme Credit" in the footer of your site (it's off by default).

If none of that sounds interesting, we're pretty much out of ideas.
