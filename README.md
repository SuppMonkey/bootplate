# BootPlate
A WordPress starter theme built on Bootstrap v3.3.x and v4 Alpha 2.

Obviously, we're still working on this, but you'll see the starter work here very soon.

## Vision
Building even totally custom WordPress themes contains a lot of repetition.  There are certain templates you just end up re-creating again and again.  Worse, you end up using a lot of functions that make the theme play well with WordPress, popular WordPress plugin classes, as well as different versions of Bootstrap.

Our vision for BootPlate is pretty simple.   Here goes.

* Use WordPress Themeing Best Practices
* Extend via Plugins (not theme-specific)
* Customize using Vanilla CSS (with some helpful stuff already there) 
* Build for Bootstrap v4 Aplha 2, with fallbacks and custom CSS for production-ready Bootstrap 3.3.x
* Mobile-first, Fast-loading (no bloat)
* No Branding--at least not ours
* Free and Open Source

There are several projects on GitHub now that helped inspire this project, including BREW, Bones, and 320.  But, this is really a starter theme for professional web designers and developers.  It doesn't include all the fancy theme customizations stuff.  Presumaby, you'll want to totally transform it--just like you would totally transform the Bootstrap theme and simply use it as a framework.

That's the vision (or intent, anyway).  Stay tuned.
